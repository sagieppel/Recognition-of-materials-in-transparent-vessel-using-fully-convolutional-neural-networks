# Recognition of materials in glassware vessels using fully convolutional neural network (FCN) in chemistry labratory setting
 
Using fully Convolutional Neural nets for the purpose of recognition and segmentation of materials in transparent vessels, with emphasis on chemistry labratory glassware. This task include labeling of each pixel in the image according to several level of classes shown in the image:
1) Vessel regions and background regions. 
2) Filled vessel regions and empty vessel regions.
3) Liquid phase and solid phase regions.
4) Exact phase pixelwise classification (Solid,Liquid,Powder,Suspension,Foamâ€¦)

Dataset of annotated images of materials in glass vessels and their pixelwise semantic segmentation,  is supplied to support this task and can be download from: [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6njwynsu2hXRFpmY1pOV1A4SFE/view?usp=sharing)

## Details input/output
The fully convolutional neural network receive an image with material in a glassware vessel and perform semantic segmentation of the image, such that that each pixel the in the image is assigned several labels. The network performed the pixelwise labeling in several level of class granularity and return for each level an image where the value of each pixel is the phase/material/object of this pixel in the image. All the predictions are generated simultaneously in one iteration of the net.
The output segmentation maps/images are as following (See image): 

a. Vessel/Background: For each pixel assign value of 1 if it in the vessel and 0 otherwise.

b. Filled/Empty: similar to above but also distinguish between filled and empty region of the vessel. For each pixel assign one of the 3 values: 0) Background, 1) Empty vessel. 2) Filled vessel 

c. Phase type: Similar to above but distinguish between liquid and solid regions of the filled vessel.   For each pixel assign one of the 4 values: 0) Background, 1) Empty vessel. 2) Liquid. 3) Solid.

d. Fine grain phase type: Similar to above but distinguish between fine  grain specific phases regions of the filled vessel. For each pixel assign one of 15 values: 1) BackGround. 2) Vessel. 3) Liquid. 4) Liquid Phase two. 5) Suspension. 6) Emulsion. 7) Foam. 8) Solid. 9) Gel. 10) Powder. 11) Granular. 12) Bulk. 13) Bulk Liquid. 14) Solid Phase two. 15) Vapor.

## Requirements
This network was run and trained with [Python 3.6 Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) package and [Tensorflow 1.1](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/).
The training was done using Nvidia GTX 1080, on Linux Ubuntu 16.04.
 
## Setup

1) Download the code from the repository.
2) Download pretrained vgg16 net and put in the /Model_Zoo subfolder in the main code folder. A pretrained vgg16 net can be download from [here](ftp://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/pub/mttt2/models/vgg16.npy) or from (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6njwynsu2hXZWcwX0FKTGJKRWs/view?usp=sharing)[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6njwynsu2hXZWcwX0FKTGJKRWs/view?usp=sharing]
3) Download dataset of images materials in transparent vessel and extract in /Data_Zoo folder in the main code dir. The dataset can be download from [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6njwynsu2hXRFpmY1pOV1A4SFE/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6njwynsu2hXRFpmY1pOV1A4SFE/view?usp=sharing) 
5) If you not interested in training the net then download a pretrained model and extract to /log folder in the main code dir. The pretrained model could be download from: [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6njwynsu2hXWi1YZ3JKRmdLOWc/view?usp=sharing)

## Tutorial
### Predicting: pixelwise classification and segmentation of images 
Run: Inference.py    
Notes: Make sure that the Image_dir variable is pointing to a valid image folders, and that the /log folder contain a trained net.

### Training network:
 Run:  Train.py 
 
 Note: Make sure the /Data_Zoo folder contain the downloaded dataset

### Evaluating net performance using intersection over union (IOU):
 
Run: Evaluate_Net_IOU.py
 
Notes:  Make sure you downloaded the dataset to /Data_Zoo and that the /log folder contain a trained net.
 
## Background 
The net is based on fully convolutional neural net described in the paper [Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jonlong/long_shelhamer_fcn.pdf)
The main modification is that the last prediction layer is split to give prediction in several level of granularity for each pixel. Similarly training of the network was done with several loss function simultaneously one for each set of classes. See BuildNetVgg16.py for the network structure. The code is based on https://github.com/shekkizh/FCN.tensorflow by Sarath Shekkizhar with MIT licence.
The net is based on the pretrained VGG16 model by [Marvin Teichmann](https://github.com/MarvinTeichmann)


## Thanks
I would like to thank Alexandra Emanuel and  Mor Bismuth for their work on labeling of the dataset. I also like to thank the creators of the Youtube channels NileRed, NurdeRage and ChemPlayer for allowing the use of frames from their videos for creating this dataset.
